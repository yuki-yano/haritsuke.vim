/**
 * Proposed solution approach:
 *
 * 1. For character-wise replace:
 *    - Need to handle cursor position after delete
 *    - May need to check if there's a space after deleted text
 *
 * 2. For motion replace (Riw):
 *    - Need to ensure motion marks are correctly captured
 *    - The operator function might not be getting correct boundaries
 *
 * 3. For line-wise replace:
 *    - VR mapping might not be working correctly
 *    - Need to verify the visual mode selection
